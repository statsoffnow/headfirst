# headfirst

This repository presents the codes taken from the book entitled "Head First Ruby"

1. The first chapter focused on creating a short game with randomly generated number to guess (it's the 'game.rb' file)
2. The second chapter presents how to create methods and how to call them (this file is called 'vehicle.rb')
